      <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence</h1>
      <p>AI is a tool that learns patterns from data to make useful outputs like suggestions, predictions, or decisions.</p>

      <div class="module__body">
        <p>Artificial Intelligence, often called AI, is a technology that allows computers to do tasks that usually need human thinking. Instead of following fixed instructions, AI systems can learn from information, recognise patterns and make decisions.</p>
        <p>Today, AI is part of everyday life. It helps recommend videos and music, recognises faces in photos, translates languages, and supports doctors, teachers, and scientists.</p>
        <p>Experts and governments around the world describe AI in similar ways. They explain that AI is a computer-based system created by humans, designed to work toward goals set by people, and able to influence the real or digital world.</p>
        <p>In simple terms, AI does not think or feel like a human, but it can analyse information and produce results that matter in real life.</p>

      <h2 class="module__title">What Artificial Intelligence Does</h2>
      <div class="module__body">
        <p>AI systems work by receiving information, processing it and producing an output. That output could be a suggestion, a prediction, or a decision.</p>
        <p>For example, when a streaming app suggests a movie, or when a phone unlocks using face recognition, AI is working behind the scenes.</p>
        <p>AI does not have opinions or emotions. It learns from examples and data given to it by humans.</p>
        <p>The quality of its results depends on how well it is designed, the data it learns from and the rules people set for it.</p>

      <h2 class="module__title">Different Types of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
      <div class="module__body">
        <p>Most AI systems today are known as narrow AI. This means they are built to perform one specific task very well.</p>
        <p>A narrow AI system might recognise speech, play a game, or help sort emails, but it cannot suddenly learn to do a completely different job.</p>
        <p>Some people talk about artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which would be an AI that can do any thinking task a human can do. This kind of AI does not exist yet and is still an idea mostly discussed in science fiction and research.</p>

      <h2 class="module__title">Learning From Data: Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h2>
      <div class="module__body">
        <p>Many modern AI systems use a method called machine learning. This means the computer learns by looking at many examples instead of being told every rule. Over time, it improves by finding patterns in the data.</p>
        <p>A more advanced form of this is deep learning, which uses layers of artificial ?neurons? inspired by the human brain.</p>
        <p>Deep learning helps AI understand images, spoken language and written text, and it powers many of the most impressive AI tools used today.</p>

      <h2 class="module__title">Generative AI: When AI Creates New Content</h2>
      <div class="module__body">
        <p>Some AI systems can create entirely new content instead of just analysing information. This is called generative AI.</p>
        <p>These systems can produce text, images, music, or videos that look or sound real.</p>
        <p>One example of generative AI is a Generative Adversarial Network, also known as a GAN. A GAN works by using two AI systems that compete with each other. One system tries to create realistic content, while the other checks whether the result looks real or fake.</p>
        <p>As they keep competing, the AI learns to create better and more realistic outputs.</p>
